        <p>
            I’m an Augusta, Ga native and former student-athlete at the University of Georgia. 
            I’m currently working on
            building data-driven products and services in the farming industry at Ecto. 
            I have an amazing wife Beth, who
            if she wasn’t one of the best customer success managers in the data privacy biz, would probably foster every
            dog and cat in the world. 
            We live in Smyrna, with our two rescued chi-chi’s 🐕🐕 (Tulip and Aziz), and two cats 🐈🐈
            (Charlie and Chamomile).
        </p>
        <p>Last but not least, we have another addition to the
            family coming at the end of February. 👶</p>

            It is the mark of an educated mind
            to be able to entertain a thought 
            without accepting it.
