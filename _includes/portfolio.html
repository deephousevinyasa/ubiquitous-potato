    <div class="position_description_wrapper">Managed agile development sprints focused on building data products and
        analytics solutions
        for the farming industry. Worked with a team of executives and product analysts to
        identify market problems and find areas of opportunity. Collaborated with designers, engineers, and data
        scientists to deliver technical
        and functional requirements. Launched a data entry management platform that gave remote managers the ability to
        manage jobs assigned to
        on-site employees. The platform helped drastically reduce the time spent collecting and cleaning data.
        Launched a content management system integrated
        with a third party business intelligence service.
        This gave us the ability to provide custom reports and dashboards to our customers without development
        support.</div>
