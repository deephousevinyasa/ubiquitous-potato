  p1: I’m an Augusta, Ga native and former student-athlete at the University of Georgia.I’m currently working on building data-driven products and services in the farming industry at Ecto. I have an amazing wife Beth, who if she wasn’t one of the best customer success managers in the data privacy biz, would probably foster every dog and cat in the world. We live in Smyrna, with our two rescued chi-chi’s 🐕🐕 (Tulip and Aziz), and two cats 🐈🐈 (Charlie and Chamomile).
  p2: Last but not least, we have another addition to the family coming at the end of February. 👶
