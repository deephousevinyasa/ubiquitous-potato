  description: Managed agile development sprints focused on building data products and analytics solutions for the farming industry. Worked with a team of executives and product analysts to identify market problems and find areas of opportunity. Collaborated with designers, engineers, and data scientists to deliver technical and functional requirements. Launched a data entry management platform that gave remote managers the ability to manage jobs assigned to on-site employees. The platform helped drastically reduce the time spent collecting and cleaning data. Launched a content management system integrated with a third party business intelligence service. This gave us the ability to provide custom reports and dashboards to our customers without development support.
