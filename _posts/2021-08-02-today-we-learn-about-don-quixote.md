One of my all-time favorite shows is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Newsroom_(American_TV_series)" target="_blank">Newsroom</a>. Will McAvoy is a guy after my own heart. In the show, Will frequently references a character/book -- Don Quixote.

I did a quick search to learn more about Don Quixote and that's how I found Thug Notes.
